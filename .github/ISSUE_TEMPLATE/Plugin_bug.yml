        # Test
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
        ```

        ## In case your repository exploded
        If you fail, you can revert the merging branch using GitHub : [Here is a tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/reverting-a-pull-request)

        If you can't revert, or if the revert doesn't work, you need to manually do it. First, check the PR number that explode your repo. You can get it using the Pull Requests menu, or checking the folder that have been edited by this PR

        After, you need to create a branch :
        1. In GitHub, click on Commit :
          ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30244939/210760305-43b9862f-91ed-4b33-87c3-abeb03ddec79.png)
        2. You will get a list of commit. Search for the commit with the name `[Publisher] Merging #{PR number - 1}` for example, `#625` if it's the `#626` PR.
        3. Click on `View commit details` :
          ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30244939/210760328-871a6601-88a0-4574-b757-2eb87ab6d258.png)
        4. Click on the browse file button
        5. Click on the commit number and type the branch name, for example, revert :
          ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30244939/210760359-536727b1-e701-4226-99ca-5cf812b16487.png)![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30244939/210760384-08810813-100a-49ee-a68f-2a6a5f9615b9.png)
        6. Now, you need to open : A local terminal console (if you have git installed) or a codespace (if you have any) for this repository. Don't forget to `git pull` if you have already cloned the repository.
        7. You need to be on your main branch, so first : `git checkout main` ; After, you have to run `git checkout revert <path to edited file or folder>`. If you want to take an entire folder, for example `docs`, just type `docs/.`. It will take all file
        8. `git commit -am "restoring folder" && git push`. If you use VScode, you can also use the menu to ordering your file restoration.
